Welcome to my revamped website. I've been meaning to overhaul this space for a while now and have finally made the jump. I always had a branch of work with attempts to redo it but always ended up not fully committing it (pun intended). This is probably the sixth or seventh time I've tried to do this.

## <Emoji>üí™</Emoji> Motivation

### üë®‚Äçüíª I wanted to redo my website.

I created the first version of my website just after I graduated from university. I was trying to promote myself while job hunting. The world of web and mobile development were new to me. But now with almost a decade of professional software development under my belt, I figured it was time to give this place a facelift with the skills I've picked up along the way.

I kept going back and forth between NextJS and Expo/Expo Router but I finally decided to go with Expo. NextJS definitely would've been the easier path to get a website set up as quickly as possible but I wanted a bit of a challenge. With my familiarity with React Native and Expo, it seemed like it would be a cool experiment to create a website/blog with it.

So special thanks to Expo, their amazing docs and [Evan Bacon](https://github.com/EvanBacon/evanbacon.dev/) for a lot of reference material! <Emoji>üíô</Emoji>

### <Emoji>‚úç</Emoji> I liked the idea of blogging.

I want somewhere to create long form posts. I've thought about using existing services like Substack and again, that's probably the easier choice but I figured with my knowledge of coding, I should apply myself. And the idea of a product or service possibly shutting down and either losing or having to migrate my content didn't sit well with me.

I also wanted somewhere to share my experiences and thoughts with React Native and React. Many times, I've come across a problem that I had to search a solution for. And many times, I could never find the same article or blog post that helped me. It can be a good reference for myself in the future in case I forget how I originally solved a problem. And hopefully if other developers come across my blog, it may be useful for them as well.

Towards the end of the pandemic, I tried learning Blender. I thought it would be neat to see my journey. And again, it would be nice to have a place that I could quickly reference issues and solutions I've come across. I know I've already forgotten a lot of the keyboard shortcuts so that will probably be my first Blender related post.

That being said, there are still a lot of work in progress and unknowns. After so many iterations and analysis paralysis, it's best put something out and continually develop it than to sit on it and dwell on the idea of perfection with the chance of it never seeing the light of day. Who knows? Maybe this will be the only post ever for my site/blog and this place will begin to collect cobwebs. <Emoji>üï∏</Emoji>

Hopefully that's not the case! <Emoji>üòÖ</Emoji>
